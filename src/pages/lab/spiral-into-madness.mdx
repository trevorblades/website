Earlier this year, I thought it would be cool to try building a spiralling triangle of text using HTML and CSS. I suppose it had no practical benefit, but like I said, I thought it would be cool. And it was.

I started by sketching in my notebook to wrap my head around the ways in which I could achieve this effect. I landed on a technique that I'll call the "curly caterpillar" method.

## The curly caterpillar

First, I lay out each of my triangle sides horizontally with each one nested within the side before it. Then I use a CSS `transform` to `rotate()` each of the sides around their left axis. Because the sides are nested, a rotation to one side will also rotate its already rotated children, causing this "curling" effect.

> Try it out below. As you apply rotation to the joints between the three segments below, they curl inward to form a triangle.

import {
  CaterpillarDemo,
  FinishedDemo,
  SpiralDemo
} from '../../components/CaterpillarDemo';

<CaterpillarDemo />

In React, one of these segment components might look something like the following. Notice the segment width is applied to the inner `span` and the rotation is applied to the outer flex parent. Each subsequent segment is nested within the previous one, after the `span` using the `children` prop.

```jsx
function Segment({children, value, width, rotation}) {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        transformOrigin: 'left',
        transform: `rotate(${rotation}deg)`
      }}
    >
      <span
        style={{
          flexShrink: 0,
          width
        }}
      >
        {value}
      </span>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

To create a triangle, arrange the above `Segment` components like the following example, and rotate all but the first segment **120°**.

The triangle I'm trying to build is [equilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_polygon), meaning each of its side lengths and angles are the same. Since the sum of all interior angles in any triangle must equal 180°, each _interior angle_ will be 60°. Knowing that each _exterior angle_ can be calculated as the sum of two interior angles, each exterior angle must be 120°. That's the amount that I need to rotate each segment to turn my flat line into a triangle.

```jsx
function Triangle() {
  const width = 100; // in pixels
  const interiorAngle = 180 / 3; // in degrees
  const exteriorAngle = interiorAngle * 2; // or 180 - interiorAngle
  return (
    // the outermost segment gets no rotation
    <Segment value="first" width={width} rotation={0}>
      <Segment value="second" width={width} rotation={exteriorAngle}>
        {/* the innermost segment gets no further children */}
        <Segment value="third" width={width} rotation={exteriorAngle} />
      </Segment>
    </Segment>
  );
}
```

## Math time

The story doesn't end here. I am trying to create a **spiral** triangle, after all. That means after drawing the first three sides, the shape needs to continue spiralling inward as long as there's room to create new segments.

The amount of room needed to draw a segment is related to the desired amount of space between parallel lines in the spiral. Let's use the following spiral with simplified measurements as an example. Its first two segments are 100 units long, and it has 20 units of spacing between its parallel lines.

import {
  Spiral1,
  Spiral2,
  Spiral3,
  Spiral4,
  Spiral5
} from '../../components/Spirals';

<Spiral1 className="spiral" />

In order to continue drawing this spiral, I needed to figure out the length of its third side. At first glance, the answer might seem obvious: just subtract 20 from the original side length of 100, and we get a side length of 80.

Unfortunately, it's not that simple. This calculation results in a side that's slightly too long to ensure the subsequent sides are correctly spaced.

<Spiral2 className="spiral" />

To find the appropriate length for side 3 and greater, we need to first calculate the length of the piece that needs to be removed. In the diagram below, I've labelled that part as $a$.

If you look closely at side $a$, it's the hypoteneuse of an imaginary right triangle that has an opposite side length equal to the gap between parallel lines in the spiral (20). We also know that one of the angles is 60° because that's the same as each interior angle in the triangle.

<Spiral3 className="spiral" />

With this knowledge, we can apply basic trigonometry to solve for $a$. Remember [**SohCahToa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry#Mnemonics)? Since we have the length of the opposite side ($O$) and want to solve for the hypoteneuse ($H$), we must use the sine function in this calculation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \sin\theta = \frac{O}{H} \\
  \sin60° = \frac{20}{a} \\
  a = \frac{20}{\sin60°} \\
  a \approx 23.09
\end{aligned}
$$

In my code, I refer to this side $a$ measurement as the _inset_. Now solving for $b$ is as easy as subtracting the inset $a$ from the original side length of 100.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  b = 100 - a \\
  b \approx 100 - 23.09 \\
  b \approx 76.91
\end{aligned}
$$

## Insets and outsets

This process of subtracting the inset from the original side length continues for each subsequent side until there's no more room to draw additional sides. In the diagram below, you can see that each inset, marked as $\vert$, is the same length.

Calculating the length of side $3$ is as simple as subtracting _one_ inset from the original side length, but side $4$ requires us to subtract one inset along with two additional lengths that I call _outsets_, marked as $\Vert$ in the diagram. Side $5$ is equal to the original side length minus two insets and two outsets, and so on.

<Spiral4 className="spiral" />

The length of an outset can be calculated using another staple of trigonometry, Pythagorean theorum. This equation, commonly expressed as $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, lets us solve for one side of a right triangle, given that we know the length of the other two sides. In this case, the spacing between parallel lines is one side, and the inset is the triangle's hypoteneuse.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\
  a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2} \\
  a = \sqrt{23.09^2 - 20^2} \\
  a \approx 11.54
\end{aligned}
$$

Knowing how to compute side lengths is great, but I need to apply this technique recursively until all sides are drawn. To do this, I needed to find a pattern or formula to follow for each side.

I drew a big spiral in my notebook and counted the insets and outsets for each side. I went 10 sides deep to see if any pattern would emerge. Here's what my results looked like:

| Side | Insets | Outsets |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| 1    | 0      | 0       |
| 2    | 0      | 0       |
| 3    | 1      | 0       |
| 4    | 1      | 2       |
| 5    | 2      | 2       |
| 6    | 3      | 2       |
| 7    | 3      | 4       |
| 8    | 4      | 4       |
| 9    | 5      | 4       |
| 10   | 5      | 6       |

The outsets column presents a clear pattern. Every three sides, the number of outsets increments by two. In mathematical notation, we could express this formula where $O$ is the number of outsets, $n$ is the current side, and $S$ is the total number of sides on the shape—3 in the case of a triangle.

$$
O = 2\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{S}\rfloor
$$

> The $\lfloor{x}\rfloor$ syntax above means "floor" or "round this number down"

The pattern for the insets was a lot more unclear, but after some trial and error, I came up with the following handy formula, where $I$ is the number of insets, and the variables $n$ and $S$ are the same as above.

$$
I = \lfloor\frac{n}{S}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{\max(n - 2, 0)}{S}\rfloor
$$

In JavaScript, these relationships would look something like this:

```js
const numInsets =
  Math.floor(side / numSides) + Math.floor(Math.max(side - 2, 0) / numSides);
const numOutsets = 2 * Math.floor((side - 1) / numSides);
```

There are three key values at play in both of these calculations:

1. `js›Math.floor(side / numSides)`
2. `js›Math.floor((side - 1) / numSides)`
3. `js›Math.floor(Math.max(side - 2, 0) / numSides)`

Notice this progression of `side`, `side - 1`, and `side - 2`? We can make this code more concise by creating these values iteratively and combining them appropriately.

```js
const [a, b, c] = Array.from({length: 3}, (_, index) =>
  Math.floor(Math.max(side - index, 0) / numSides)
);
const numInsets = a + c;
const numOutsets = 2 * b;
```

## Drawing the spiral

So far in this post, I've explained how I was able to:

- Render a triangle with CSS
- Understand the relationships between side length, spacing, insets, and outsets
- Calculate the value of insets and outsets
- Determine the number of insets and outsets needed per side

Now it's time to put all of these tools together to draw a spiral.

I never managed to discover a formula for calculating the total number of segments needed in a spiral, so I opted for a different strategy here. Using a while loop, I would calculate the width of one segment at a time, pushing them into an array as long as they were "long enough".

How long is long enough? For this project, I decided that I didn't want any segment to be any shorter than the length of the inset. This would ensure consistent spacing within the spiral, down to the very last segment.

```js
const segments = [];

while (width > inset) {
  // get the current side based on the number of segments already created
  const side = segments.length + 1;

  // determine the number of insets and outsets for that side
  const [a, b, c] = Array.from({length: 3}, (_, index) =>
    Math.floor(Math.max(side - index, 0) / numSides)
  );
  const numInsets = a + c;
  const numOutsets = 2 * b;

  // calculate the side length by subtracting the appropriate number of insets
  // and outsets from the original side length
  const sideLength = width - inset * numInsets - outset * numOutsets;

  // if the calculated side length is less than the length of the inset, break
  // the loop
  if (sideLength < inset) {
    break;
  }

  // otherwise, add side length to the front of the array of segments
  segments.unshift(sideLength);
}
```

Remember that in order to use the curly caterpillar method, I need to nest my segments within one another. In React, it's common to `map` over an array and render components based on its items, but that would result in a flat list rather than the nested structure I'm after.

Instead, I opted to use `js›Array.reduce` to recursively wrap HTML elements around each previous wrapped element. Using this strategy, I start from the innermost segment and continue wrapping out to the first segment in the spiral. This is why I used `js›Array.unshift` instead of `js›Array.push` in the example above. I needed to make sure my final array would be ordered from innermost at the start to outermost at the end.

```jsx
<>
  {segments.reduce(
    (child, width, index, array) => (
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'flex',
          transformOrigin: 'left',
          transform:
            // don't rotate the first segment (last item in the array)
            index === array.length - 1 ? 'none' : `rotate(${exteriorAngle}rad)`
        }}
      >
        <span
          style={{
            flexShrink: 0,
            width,
            height: 2,
            backgroundColor: 'currentcolor'
          }}
        />
        {/* render the previous child within this segment */}
        {child}
      </div>
    ),
    null // previous child is null by default
  )}
</>
```

Et voilà! I now have a component that renders a beautiful triangular spiral given a width and amount of spacing. Play around with the demo below to see this method in action. Notice how new segments get added or subtracted as the spiral size and spacing changes.

<SpiralDemo />

As you change the width of the spiral in the example above, you'll notice the height of its container changing as well. The height of a triangle like this one can be calculated by dividing the triangle in two and measuring the long vertical side indicated by the dashed line in the following diagram.

<Spiral5 className="spiral" />

Each half is a right triangle, and we already know two side lengths and all interior angles, so we have two options for calculating the remaining side:

1. Use Pythagorean theorum ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$)
2. Use the sine ratio ($\sin\theta = \frac{O}{H}$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\
  a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2} \\
  a = \sqrt{100^2 - 50^2} \\
  a \approx 86.60
\end{aligned}
$$

Pick your poison—either method will yeild the same result.

## Adding the text

Drawing a spiral is cool, but my goal was to draw a _spiral of text_. Adding text to the segments is easy enough. I replace the `height` and `background-color` styles with `css›text-align: center` and add the text as children to the `span`.

```jsx
<span
  style={{
    flexShrink: 0,
    width,
    // height: 2,
    // backgroundColor: 'currentcolor'
    textAlign: 'center'
  }}
>
  text goes here
</span>
```

Since most sides of the spiral have variable lengths, the next challenge was making sure that the amount of text in each side was proportional with the amount of space available. For example, a string of text that would fit nicely into the first side would exceed the length of sides 3 and greater.

My initial strategy was to split my string of text into an array of strings, each one corresponding to a side. As I create my segments, I save the segment's computed width _and_ text value, and access them as properties on the `segment` object in the reduce function.

```jsx
const text = [
  'this is some text',
  'that i think will',
  'fit into',
  'the sides',
  'of my',
  'spiral'
];

while (width > inset) {
  // calculate inset/outset count and side length as before
  segments.unshift({
    width: sideLength,
    text: text[side - 1]
  });
}

return (
  <>
    {segments.reduce((child, segment) => (
      <div style={/* segment wrapper styles */}>
        <span style={/* same as above */}>
          {/* add text as a child of the span */}
          {segment.text}
        </span>
        {child}
      </div>
    ))}
  </>
);
```

This strategy worked, but it required a lot of trial and error to come up with text strings that filled the space nicely. It also meant that when I changed the size or spacing of my spiral, my perfectly curated text strings would need to be updated to fit the new proportions. Super annoying.

I tried to imagine a better alternative. What if I could just pass a single string of text, and the spiral component would automatically distribute the words in the string across each side? If it runs out of words to fill space with, it would start over from the beginning of the string. Rinse and repeat this process until all the space is accounted for.

To do this, I need to understand how many characters will fit into a given space. If my spiral component accepts a `fontSize` prop, I can make an approximation of the average character width based on that. Then I divide the side length by this approximate character width, and I've got my character allowance.

```js
const charWidth = fontSize / 1.5;
let numChars = Math.floor(sideLength / charWidth);
```

Then, I split the provided text (supplied as `children` to the spiral component) into individual words, and use a while loop to add words to a segment until there's no room for more characters. Every time I take one word from the `words` array, I put it back on the end of the array for reuse later on.

```js
const words = children
  .trim() // trim leading/trailing space
  .replace(/\s+/, ' ') // turn one or more consecutive spaces into one space
  .split(' '); // split into array of words

let text = '';
while (numChars > 0) {
  const word = words.shift(); // get the first element
  words.push(word); // put it back on the end of the array
  text += word.text; // add it to the segment's text
  numChars -= word.text.length; // adjust the number of remaining characters
}

segment.push({
  width: sideLength,
  text
});
```

The only problem with this solution is it doesn't replace the spaces between words in my text string. It also suffers from an issue where a single word is too long to fit into one side.

To account for this, I modified my while loop to insert a portion of a word if there aren't enough characters left to fit the whole thing. I then put the remainder of that word back on the front of the words array so that it gets rendered first on the next segment before continuing with the next word in the stack.

I need to be able to differentiate between full words and fragments to avoid pushing fragments onto the _end_ of the words array as I'm doing with all words near the top of the while loop in the example above. So each word in the original array gets an `isFullWord` flag that I can check in the while loop to decide whether to `push` it on to the words array.

```js
const words = children
  // trim and split logic from before
  .map(text => ({
    text,
    isFullWord: true // mark as full word
  }));
```

After every full word, I add a space if there are more than one character slots remaining in that segment. This is to avoid having a space be the last character of any segment. Here's what the updated while loop body looks like now:

```js
const word = words.shift(); // get the first element

// return it to the end of the stack if it's a full word
if (word.isFullWord) {
  words.push(word);
}

// if there isn't enough space for the full word
if (word.text.length > numChars) {
  // grab the part of it that will fit
  const fragment = word.text.slice(0, numChars);
  // and put the rest of it back into the front of the stack
  words.unshift({
    text: word.text.slice(numChars),
    isFullWord: false // not a full word
  });
  text += fragment;
  numChars -= fragment.length;
} else {
  // otherwise add the word to the segment
  text += word.text;
  numChars -= word.text.length;
  if (numChars > 1) {
    // add a space if there's room
    text += ' ';
    numChars -= 1;
  } else if (numChars) {
    // otherwise bail out and complete the segment
    break;
  }
}
```

## Cosmetic upgrades 💅

I changed the way that I render the segment text so that its characters are spaced evenly within each segment, sort of like what `css›text-align: justify` does for words in a line. First I split the segment text into an array of characters, and render them each as separate `span` elements. Then I give their parent `css›display: flex` and `css›justify-content: space-evenly`, as well as `css›white-space: pre` to preserve solitary space characters.

```jsx
<span
  style={{
    flexShrink: 0,
    display: 'flex',
    whiteSpace: 'pre',
    justifyContent: 'space-evenly',
    width
  }}
>
  {text.split('').map((char: string, index: number) => (
    <span key={index}>{char}</span>
  ))}
</span>
```

I also added some padding on the start and end of each segment to prevent text from overlapping at the points of my shape. I found that two thirds of a character width was an amount that worked well for this.

```js
const padding = charWidth / 1.5;
```

I refactored the code in my segment-creating code to account for this padding's effect on the amount of space available for text, and thus the number of characters available to each segment.

```js
const innerWidth = sideLength - padding * 2; // subtract padding from each end
const numChars = Math.floor(innerWidth / charWidth);
```

Finally, I add the padding to my segment elements.

```jsx
<span
  style={{
    // other segment text styles
    padding
  }}
>
  {/* render text */}
</>
```

At last, a triangle spiral of text. 😌 If you've made it this far in the post, I applaud you. 👏 Enjoy one last demo where you can experiment with _all_ of the variables at play in this component.

<FinishedDemo />

## Appendix

If I could make this work for a triangle, how hard could it be to make it work for other **regular polygons**?

> A [regular polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon) is any polygon where all of its sides and angles are equal, like the equilateral triangle in this post, or a square, hexagon, etc.

It turns out that a lot of the fundamental parts of this implementation can be applied to shapes with more sides. There were only a handful of adjustments I had to make for my spiral component to be shape-agnostic.

### Exterior angles

The angle that I used to rotate the segments in my triangle was fixed at 120°, but as the number of sides on my shape changes, so too must this angle. The formula to find a regular polygon's exterior angle is $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{n}$ where $n$ is the number of sides.

```js
const exteriorAngle = (Math.PI * 2) / numSides;
```

### Shape height

Finding the height of a triangle was relatively easy; divide the triangle in two and measure the long vertical side. The process of measuring the height of a regular polygon is more difficult.

$$
h=\left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    2Ri & N\text{ is even} \\
    Rc + Ri & N\text{ is odd}
  \end{array}
\right.
$$

- height of the shape - bounding box
- centering the shape (padding-top)
- inverting the outset (adding instead of subtracting)
