description: Some notes from my adventure into the world of geometry

- The idea
- Creating a triangle by cascading CSS rotations
- Calculating the degree of each rotation

Once upon a time, I wanted to build a spiral...

- laying out text as a spiral
- first idea (caterpillar)
- text segments nested within eachother
- each segment's rotation rotates its children too, curling up like a pill bug
- how much should each segment rotate?
- how to maintain space between layers of the spiral?
- how to decide where to clip text? first approach: manually supply text segments
- problem with that: doesn't work reliably when the # of sides changes or the size of the spiral changes
- auto-splitting text might leave a bunch of empty space
- solution: just keep repeating the text if it ends early

- talk about circle expanding to viewport
- pixel site does this: https://store.google.com/ca/product/pixel_5?hl=en-GB
- trig principles at play here
