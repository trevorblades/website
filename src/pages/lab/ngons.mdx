Earlier this year, I thought it would be cool to try building a spiralling triangle of text using HTML and CSS. I suppose it had no practical benefit, but like I said, I thought it would be cool. And it was.

I started by sketching in my notebook to wrap my head around the ways in which I could achieve this effect. I landed on a technique that I'll call the "curly caterpillar" method.

## The Curly Caterpillar™

First, I lay out each of my triangle sides horizontally with each one nested within the side before it. Then I use a CSS `transform` to `rotate()` each of the sides around their left axis. Because the sides are nested, a rotation to one side will also rotate its already rotated children, causing this "curling" effect.

> Try it out below. You apply some rotation to each of the two segments in this triangle and their rotations are multiplied because they are conjoined.

import CaterpillarDemo from '../../components/CaterpillarDemo';

<CaterpillarDemo />

a² + b² = c²

- The idea
- Creating a triangle by cascading CSS rotations
- Calculating the degree of each rotations

Once upon a time, I wanted to build a spiral...

- laying out text as a spiral
- first idea (caterpillar)
- text segments nested within eachother
- each segment's rotation rotates its children too, curling up like a pill bug
- how much should each segment rotate?
- how to maintain space between layers of the spiral?
- how to decide where to clip text? first approach: manually supply text segments
- problem with that: doesn't work reliably when the # of sides changes or the size of the spiral changes
- auto-splitting text might leave a bunch of empty space
- solution: just keep repeating the text if it ends early
