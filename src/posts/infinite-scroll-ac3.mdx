Infinite scroll is a web design technique that loads more content as the user scrolls towards the end of the loaded content. It creates the effect of a never-ending stream of content and can provide a more fluid alternative to conventional pagination. You can find examples everywhere on the web, like when you scroll through posts on Twitter or Instagram, or view search results in sites like [Giphy](https://giphy.com/search/sloth).

In this post, I'm going to demonstrate how to use Apollo Client 3 to create an infinite scoll effect using data from a GraphQL API.
