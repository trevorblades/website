title: 'Using KaTeX With Gatsby and MDX'
description: How to write mathematical notation in your blog posts
---

In my [spiral](/lab/spiral-into-madness) and [circle](/lab/circle-transition) posts, I relied heavily on mathematical notation to explain formulas and equations that I used to build those features. Before then, I had never had to use mathematical notation in any web or computer context.

After some searching on the web, I learned that [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) was the right tool for the job. It takes a string of text written in [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) syntax and outputs nicely formatted mathematical notation.

> TeX's creator Donald Knuth promotes a pronunciation of /ËˆtÉ›x/ (tekh), similar to the last sound of the German word "Bach". So you would say "kay-tekh" rather than "kay-tex".

In Markdown, it's common to see $\TeX$ written inside math blocks beginning and ending with `$$`.

```md
$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$
```

The above Markdown becomes the following when processed by $\KaTeX$:

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

Processing the Markdown math blocks with $\KaTeX$ is _not_ part of the basic offering of most Markdown renderers, and I needed to configure that part myself.

My website is built with Gatsby and MDX using `gatsby-plugin-mdx`, which accepts remark and rehype plugins as configuration options. Luckily there's a handful of plugins built for this purpose, such as `remark-math`, `rehype-katex`, and `gatsby-remark-katex`. Sadly, none of these libraries play nicely with the current stable version of MDX (1.6.x at the time of writing), only plain ol' Markdown.

I stumbled upon [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/28031) related to this topic and experimented with the different "solutions" posted by others. The one that worked for me looks like this:

```bash
npm i remark-math@3 remark-html-katex@3 katex
```

It's important to install older versions of the two remark plugins since the newest versions are ESM only and Gatsby doesn't support ES modules in their `gatsby-*.js` files.

```js file=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-mdx',
      options: {
        remarkPlugins: [require('remark-math'), require('remark-html-katex')]
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

Lastly, add the remark plugins to your `gatsby-plugin-mdx` configuration and import the stylesheet from the `katex` package into your client-side bundle.

```js file=gatsby-browser.js
import 'katex/dist/katex.css';
```

That's it! I hope you found this short guide to be helpful in setting up $\KaTeX$ in your Gatsby site. If not, it better have at least been interesting. ðŸ˜‹
