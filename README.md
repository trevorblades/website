# Trevor Blades' website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/506b0fa2-e00c-4503-ae8d-b301fedbaad4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/confident-pasteur-f08efe/deploys)

Hello adventurer! This site is where I show off the work that I've done in the past and write posts about features that I've built in the past. It's built using Gatsby and React, and my posts are authored using MDX.

Please take a look around and check out some of the techniques I used to build the site. If you have any questions about the techniques used, hit me up [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/trevorblades) and ask away.
